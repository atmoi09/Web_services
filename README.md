# This solution was created for the final assignment of a university course.

The solution was created for the 02267 Software Development of Web Services Jan 22 course at DTU in collaboration with my teammates. Doman-Driven Design was used to blueprint a service oriented architecture using facade, factory and adapter design patterns. The solution was coded in Java using RabbitMQ for the messaging service of the architecture. The services were containerized by docker and the solution was deployed in CICD pipeline using Jenkins for automated testing.
